(defprotocol StateManager
  "Protocol for managing state for recording which requests are in flight, so we can determine whether responses
  correspond to valid requests. This library ships with a simple in-memory implementation, but this interface is
  provided so that you can provide your own implementation if you need to do something more sophisticated (such as
  synchronizing across multiple instances)."
  (record-request! [this request-id]
    "Called whenever a new request to the IdP goes out. The state manager should record `request-id` (and probably the
    current timestamp as well) so it can be used for validating responses.")

  ;; TODO -- consider renaming this to handle-response! or something else clearer
  (accept-response! [this request-id]
    "Called whenever a new response from IdP is received. The state manager should verify that `request-id` was
 actually issued by us (e.g., one we've seen earlier when `record-request!`), and (hopefully) that it is not too old;
 if the response is not acceptable, it must throw an Exception. The state manager should remove the request from its
 state a response with the same ID cannot be used again (e.g. to prevent replay attacks)."))

;; in-memory-state-manager state works like this:
;;
;; - State consists of three buckets. After every timeout/2 seconds, the oldest bucket is dropped and a new one is
;; created. Buckets are thus:
;;
;; 1. Requests created after last rotation. Thus requests in this bucket are between 0 and timeout/2 seconds old.
;;
;; 2. Requests that have survived one rotation. Requests in this bucket are between ~0 and timeout seconds old. (They
;; can be ~0 if they were added to the bucket immediately before it was rotated, and rotation just occurred; or
;; ~timeout if they were added to the bucket when it was first created and the next rotation is about to occur).
;;
;; 3. Requests that have survived two rotations. Requests in this bucket are at least timeout/2 seconds old, and at
;; most (timeout*1.5) seconds old.
;;
;; Thus after the two rotations we know a request is at least timeout/2 seconds old, and after three we know it is
;; older than timeout and can drop it.
;;
;; buckets look like: [bucket-created-instant #{request-id}]
;;
;; Note that this means `timeout` means the earliest that a request ID gets dropped, but does not guarantee it will be
;; dropped by then; it make take up to timeout*1.5.
